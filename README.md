# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

This is our first module challenge at the ASU bootcamp which employed the use of Javascript. In this challenge, we were required to modify starter code in order to create a website that would allow a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll information. The website itself contains an employee roster, with fields for 'First Name', 'Last Name', and 'Salary', as well as an 'add employees' button. The following is an image of what someone could potentially be presented with upon viewing the page.

## Usage

Upon opening the page and selecting the 'add employees' button, the user will be presented with the text box used to add the name and salary for their employees. After filling out the aforementioned fields, the user will be presented with the option to continue adding more employees to the roster, or, the option to press cancel, logging all the information they've submitted onto the page. Furthermore, upon viewing the console in dev tools, the user will be able to see the total number of employees logged, as well as their average salary. There is also a function that logs an employee, at random, on to the console. The following is an image of what they page may look like with dev tools opened.
